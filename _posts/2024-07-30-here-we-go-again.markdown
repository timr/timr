It's been a long time since this domain hosted a website. I restarted the site over on
[Github Pages][git] which utilizes [Jekyll][jekyll] to create a static website. Back in
the dats of AWS S3, I was hand editing HTML files and got to repetitive and boring. Plus,
S3 costs money and I'm cheap.

The hope is to put my time here instead of on Facebook. Facebook these days would rather
show me sponsored ads and suggested content than anything my friends have written. Here
will be a brain dump of what I'm doing whether that be working on my homelab, cycling,
trying to help that cats in our neighborhood (all one of them), or whatever. Let's get
this show on the road!
